# Efficient-and-Adversarially-Robust-Electricity-Theft-Detection-Approach

Detecting electricity theft in smart grids using deep learning models faces several challenges related to privacy preservation and computational efficiency while maintaining high detection capabilities. One serious attack threatening privacy is the Gradient Inversion (GI) where an attacker can reconstruct original consumer data from a model's gradients. To address these problems, this paper presents a novel framework that combines prototype learning with Differential Privacy (DP) in training a binary classification model. This approach leverages K-means clustering to produce representative prototypes from data on electricity consumption, thus, significantly reducing the size of the training dataset. Then, an adaptive DP mechanism is implemented to effectively protect against GI attacks, achieving a higher mean squared error in reconstruction attempts compared to a baseline model without security measures. Our experimental results highlight a high electricity theft detection accuracy of 93.49\% with a 75.9\% decrease in training time, using only 20.4\% of the number of samples used to train a baseline model, and an improved robustness against GI attacks, all ideal for large-scale smart grid operations.
